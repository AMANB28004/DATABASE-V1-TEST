This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your Node.js-based recipe-sharing application. The application includes user authentication, recipe management, and a user-friendly interface for viewing, adding, and managing recipes. The deployment process involves setting up a server, configuring a database, and hosting the application for public access.

Before deploying the application, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Node.js and npm installed on your server or development machine.
- MySQL server installed and running.
- Git installed for cloning the repository.

. Connect to the server via SSH and update the system packages using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. Install Node.js and npm:
   - Use the command `sudo apt install nodejs npm`.
2. Install MySQL server:
   - Use the command `sudo apt install mysql-server`.
3. Secure the MySQL installation using `sudo mysql_secure_installation`.

Step 4: Deploy the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   - `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   - `cd recipe-sharing`
3. Install project dependencies:
   - `npm install`
4. Configure the database connection in `db.js`.
Step 5: Start the Application
1. Start the server:
   - `node app.js`
